//               (all the collection interfaces,
//              Syntax import package.classname

// WE can also define the user define packages
// For example someone needs to access our classes they can easily do that by accessing our package name automation here.

/* 1. Class A can use the Class B directly if both Class A & Class B belongs to the same Package with
      the help of object (create an object and we can call the methods present in the class)
   2. If we need to access the methods present in another package but not in current package then
      we need to import that package into current package by using the syntax
      syntax import packagename.classname;  Example : Payment page where you have to access diff package.
      in this way we can handle multiple packages so there is no conflict eg. payment package, coupon package.
